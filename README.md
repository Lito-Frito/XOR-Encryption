# XOR Block Cipher Algorithm
## [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/crc8109/XOR-Encryption)](https://repl.it/github/crc8109/XOR-Encryption)
This is a simple CLI app I made that showcases how XOR is implemented in encryption. I made this because we learned about how encryption works in my grad class and I wanted a tool to help people visualize how one of the basic techniques in encryption works.

If you've ever wondered how encryption works, XOR is used in many different types of encryption algorithms at some point.

## What This Includes
`simp_xor.py`: The example script to showcase XOR encryption.

# Getting Started

## Requirements
* Python3
* a CLI (if you're on Windows, this is the Command Prompt; for Linux and Mac, this is your terminal)

## Quick Start
Download the file `simp_xor.py` and then open the CLI from the folder that has the `simp_xor.py` file. Run the file by typing `python3 simp_xor.py`.

OR

You can go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/@crc8109/XOR-Encryption#.replit) where I'm hosting the app in a personal repl. When you click the link, just hit > Run:arrow_forward: and the app will start up.

If this doesn't work, feel free to reach out.
